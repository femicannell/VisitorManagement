Heading What is Pathfinders? 
Pathfinders is an activity based organisation especially designed for 10 - 15 year olds. It is an international uniformed organisation that is sponsored by the local Seventh-day Adventist churches, and operated by trained volunteers. 
Pathfindering is a worldwide program organised and directed by the Department of Youth Ministries at the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It offers a wide range of learning experiences for young people 10 - 15 years of age and is operated by the local Seventh-day Adventist Church under the direction and control of the Youth Director in each respective Conference/Mission.
Heading Philosophy 
The Pathfinder club provides a church-centred spiritual-recreational program designed for junior and teens which appeals to this age group because its program features activities that meet their needs and interests. 
Pathfinders is filled with action, adventure, challenge and group activities while providing opportunities for the development of new attitudes and skills that produce personal growth, team spirit and a sense of loyalty and respect for God, His creation and His church.
Heading Safety 
All leaders or pathfinders over the age of 16 are required to partake in the church's AdSafe course which focusses on safety for children in the church. This ensures that every child under the care of the pathfinder group leaders is in a safe environment for the whole time they are at a club day or event.
